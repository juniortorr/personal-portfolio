# My Personal Portfolio Website


Hi All! This is my portfolio website that I recently made. You can view it here at https://juniortorr.github.io/personal-portfolio/ .
This project was made with HTML CSS and Javascript. I really tried to put a heavy focus on the responsiveness of this website. It also uses the MailSlurp Api to send emails through contact box.
I tried my best to make the website as modular as I can so that I can expand sections based on personal growth such as skills. Enjoy!
